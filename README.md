# FlightNetworkAnalysis

## Overview

**FlightNetworkAnalysis** is a Python project designed for visualizing and analyzing airport and flight route data. This project utilizes Streamlit and NetworkX to create interactive network graphs and perform various analyses on flight data.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Use Streamlit to interactively explore and visualize flight routes and airport networks.
- **Network Analysis:** Leverage NetworkX for analyzing network properties such as centrality, connectivity, and shortest paths.
- **Data Insights:** Analyze flight data to gain insights into the structure and dynamics of global air traffic.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehark56/FlightNetworkAnalysis.git
   cd FlightNetworkAnalysis
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   This will start a local server and open the Streamlit app in your default web browser.

2. **Explore the interactive visualizations** to analyze flight routes and airport networks.

## Data

The project relies on data files located in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the dataset files are in the correct format and path before running the analysis.
